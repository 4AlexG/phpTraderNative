# Chaikin A/D Line

This indicator is a volume based indicator developed by Marc Chaikin which measures the cumulative flow of money into and out of an instrument.
The A/D line is calculated by multiplying the specific periodâ€™s volume with a multiplier that is based on the relationship of the closing price to the high-low range.
The A/D Line is formed by the running total of the Money Flow Volume. This indicator can be used to assert an underlying trend or to predict reversals.
The combination of a high positive multiplier value and high volume indicates buying pressure.
So even with a downtrend in prices when there is an uptrend in the Accumulation Distribution Line there is indication for buying pressure (accumulation) that may result to a bullish reversal.
Conversely a low negative multiplier value combined with, again, high volumes indicates selling pressure (distribution).
